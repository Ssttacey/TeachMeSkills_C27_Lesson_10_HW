Homework for the tenth lesson

This project is an example of a program that stores information about a client and his cards. The program has the ability to compare cards according to certain parameters and display the number of identical cards the client has. The card class has the fields: svv, card number, amount of money. The method contained in the program allows you to compare objects without taking into account the amount of money. The client class has fields: full name, country, passport number and card. The program also allows you to display information about the client without a passport number. That is, maintaining data confidentiality.
